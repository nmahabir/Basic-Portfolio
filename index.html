    <p>Hey Everyone! Natalia here, just a kid from Trinidad and Tobago, the beautiful twin island state in the Caribbean.
        Moved to Canada for University and just had to stay! 
        Currently an Electrical Designer, and now dipping my toes in the Development World!
        Hope you enjoy this site!
        Keep cool kids!
